## Tree Walk Interpreter of a Subset of Prolog

To execute:

```bash
dune exec prolog examples/list.pl
```

It's better to use `rlwrap` to get persistent history and completion:

```bash
rlwrap dune exec prolog examples/list.pl
```

To get more answers type `;` and `enter`. If you don't want another answer type `enter`.

Our subset of Prolog is described by ![this grammar](diagram.xhtml)
